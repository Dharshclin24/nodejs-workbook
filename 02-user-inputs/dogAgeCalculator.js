/* 

Your task: Make a dog age calculator with Node.js!

Follow the instructions in the README.md file in this folder.
Running node index.js Maisie 3 should output: "Your dog, Maisie, is 3 years old, but that's 29 years old in dog years!"
Year 1 of a dog's life is 15 dog years
Year 2 is the equivalent of another 9 years.
Every year after that is the equivalent of another 5 years.



Similarly, running node index.js Ralph 4 should output, "Your dog, Ralph, is 4 years old, but that's 34 years old in dog years!"



Run this file with the node command:
node dogAgeCalculator.js

*/
//------global variables declared to hold the value of dog name and human age in the array places of 2 & 3 
let dogName = process.argv[2];
let humanAge = Number(process.argv[3]);
//---function and variable declared to calculate the dog age in human years----

let dogAge 
if (humanAge === 1) {
  dogAge = 15;
} else if (humanAge === 2) {
  dogAge = 15 + 9;
} else if (humanAge > 2) {
  dogAge = 15 + 9 + (humanAge -2) * 5;
} 

//-----console log created to run the script---
  console.log(
    `${dogName} is ${humanAge} human years old, which is ${dogAge} in dog years.`
  );
